## Behaviour, play and feelings
Your toddler is curious about everything and is keen to play, experiment and explore.

Play is very important for your child – it’s how she develops thinking, imagination and creativity. Your toddler might particularly enjoy games like finding hidden toys and pointing to body parts.

When it comes to emotions, your child has developed strong attachments to the people he loves. You’ll find your toddler gives you lots of cuddles and kisses. But he might also be very aware of himself and even embarrassed when he realises other people are looking at him. If he’s separated from you, he might get upset – separation anxiety is quite normal at this age.

## Talking 
When it comes to language development, your child might say a few words by 15 months. She’ll learn more and more words in the coming months and might start naming objects and actions.

Your child is starting to understand his own name, and simple commands like ‘Bring it to Mum’. And he almost certainly understands ‘mine’!

## Movement 
Your toddler might already be walking on her own. If not, she’ll probably take her first steps during the next few months. If your toddler has been walking for a while, she might soon start running, or even climbing the stairs or furniture.

Hand movements like scribbling, turning pages in a book, using a spoon, drinking from a cup or building a tower of blocks are much easier for your toddler now.

At this age, your child might also:
- take off some of his clothes
- seat himself in a small chair, or try to get into your chair
- get something from another room when you ask him to
- pick up very small objects – for example, pebbles or crumbs.

# When to be concerned about toddler development
See your child and family health nurse or GP if you have any concerns or notice that at 15-18 months your toddler has any of the following issues.

## Seeing, hearing and communicating
Your child:
- has trouble seeing or hearing things
- doesn’t say any single words
- doesn’t follow simple instructions – for example, ‘Please give me the ball’
- doesn’t point, wave or use other gestures.

## Behaviour and play 
Your child:
- doesn’t enjoy eye contact or cuddles with you
- doesn’t pretend during play – for example, pretend to have a tea party or feed a doll.

## Movements and motor skills
Your child:
- isn’t walking by himself
- uses one hand a lot more than the other (usually children don’t use one hand more than the other until closer to two years).
- You should see a child health professional if you notice your child has lost skills she had before.

You should also see your child and family health nurse or GP if you notice the signs of postnatal depression in women or postnatal depression in men in yourself or your partner. Symptoms of postnatal depression include feeling sad and crying for no obvious reason, feeling irritable, having difficulty coping and feeling very anxious.
