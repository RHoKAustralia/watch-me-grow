Your baby will soon be 12 months old! It’s amazing how much your baby has developed in the last year.

Your baby is now communicating in many ways – pointing, grunting, nodding, waving and often trying to talk to you too. Her babbling sounds more like a conversation, and she might say a couple of single words she understands like ‘dada’ and ‘mama’.

Over the past few months your baby has learned to show emotions like caution and fear. He might also be more aware of his own needs, and can let you know what he wants.

Play is important, because it’s how your baby learns. Your baby might look at, shake, bang, throw, drop and poke different objects. She enjoys playing with you and might start showing you things she’s playing with – for example, a toy or doll.

Your baby is getting better at using his hands and fingers and will probably use his fingers to feed himself at most meals.

Your baby might pull herself up to stand by holding onto furniture, or she might even stand well by herself. Around now, she might take her first steps on her own or could even be walking by herself. Walking is tiring for her, though, so sometimes she might crawl instead.

At this age your baby might also:
- bounce to music
- cooperate more when he’s getting dressed
- follow instructions like ‘Give me the block’ or ‘Put the train down’
- start to link words with their meanings – for example, when you say ‘ball’ or ‘teddy’ he might look around for these things.

# When to be concerned about baby development

See your child and family health nurse or GP if you have any concerns or notice that your one-year-old has any of the following issues.

## Seeing and hearing 
Your child:
- isn’t making eye contact with you, isn’t following moving objects with his eyes or has an eye that is turned in or out most of the time
- isn’t interested in sounds
- doesn’t respond to his name when called.

## Communicating 
Your child:
- isn’t babbling or using single words
- isn’t trying to let you know what she wants
- isn’t pointing to objects or pictures, or using gestures like waving
- doesn’t seem to understand you.

## Behaviour and play 
Your child isn’t showing emotions like happiness or sadness.

## Movement and motor skills 
Your child:
- isn’t crawling
- isn’t standing when he holds onto you or furniture
- uses one hand a lot more than the other.

You should also see a child health professional if you notice that your baby has lost skills she had before.

You should also see your child and family health nurse or GP if you notice the signs of postnatal depression in women or postnatal depression in men in yourself or your partner. Symptoms of postnatal depression include feeling sad and crying for no obvious reason, feeling irritable, having difficulty coping and feeling very anxious.
