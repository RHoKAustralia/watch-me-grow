This is an exciting time for your baby. Her imagination comes alive now. She’s also better at remembering – for example, her favourite people, toys and books.

Your baby’s emotions keep developing. Baby will let you know when he’s happy and sad and can also tell how you’re feeling by your tone of voice and the look on your face.

Your baby might show signs of strong attachment to family members or carers, and even prefer some toys and books to others. At the same time, you might see signs of separation anxiety or stranger anxiety. It might help you to know that separation anxiety and stranger anxiety are a normal part of a child’s development.

You might hear a lot of babbling from your baby. She might also respond to her own name, stop when she hears ‘no’, turn to sounds and look for familiar objects when you name them.

Around this time, baby will start letting you know when he’s had enough to eat – often by waving his hand or turning his head away. When you’re feeding him, you might see the first signs of teeth.

Around this age your baby can roll both ways and might start to move around the house by commando crawling. She might even crawl using her hands and knees. If you hold her, she might be able to stand and bounce up and down.

Your baby is learning all the time, often by putting things in his mouth or looking closely at what’s in his hand. He’ll bang and shake toys and try to grab blocks. When he can’t reach objects he wants, he’ll look to you for help.

At this age your baby might also:
- sit up without help, sometimes using her arms for balance
- pick up smaller objects and use her fingers to drag things towards herself
- pat her own image in the mirror
- look for (and find!) partly hidden objects
- listen to music.

# When to be concerned about baby development

See your child and family health nurse or GP if you have any concerns or notice that your seven-month-old is having any of the following issues.

## Seeing, hearing and communicating 
Your child:
- isn’t making eye contact with you, isn’t following moving objects with his eyes or has an eye that is turned in or out most of the time
- isn’t babbling
- isn’t turning towards sounds or voices.

## Behaviour 
Your child:
- doesn’t smile or show if she’s happy or sad
- shows little or no affection for carers – for example, she doesn’t cuddle you.

## Movement 
Your child:
- isn’t rolling
- feels very floppy or stiff
- can’t sit up or stand up with your help
- uses one hand a lot more than the other.
- If you notice that your child has lost skills he once had, you should see a child health professional.

You should also see your child and family health nurse or GP if you notice the signs of postnatal depression in women or postnatal depression in men in yourself or your partner. Symptoms of postnatal depression include feeling sad and crying for no obvious reason, feeling irritable, having difficulty coping and feeling very anxious.
