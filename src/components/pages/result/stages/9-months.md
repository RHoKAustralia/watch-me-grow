Waving goodbye, pointing, babbling, clapping hands, crawling, pulling up to stand – there’s a lot happening for your baby.

At this age, your baby is having a growth spurt in his brain. This improves his memory and you might notice him forming stronger attachments to his favourite people, toys and books.

Your baby might even prefer a particular person – this could be you, your partner, or another close family member or carer. Getting upset when you’re not there (separation anxiety) and anxiety around strangers is pretty common at this age. It might help to know that it’s a normal part of a child’s development.

You’ll start to get an idea of what your child might be like in the future, as she starts showing you her personality. Her emotions are maturing too – she can express fear and also read and respond to your facial expressions.

Your baby is starting to link words with their meanings and understand your body language – for example, if you point at something, he might look towards it. He’ll still be babbling, and might say ‘mama’ or ‘dada’ without knowing what these words mean. You might even hear 1-2 other words, if baby is an early talker.

At this age your baby might also:

- copy sounds or make noises to get your attention
- practise her eating skills by holding, biting and chewing food
- look closely at everything she picks up – for example, she might ring bells, bang blocks and find hidden objects
- walk by holding on to your hands or the furniture, or she might even try walking without any help at all.

# When to be concerned about baby development
See your child and family health nurse or GP if you have any concerns or notice that your nine-month-old is having any of the following issues.

## Seeing, hearing and communicating
Your child:

- isn’t making eye contact with you, isn’t following moving objects with her eyes or has an eye that is turned in or out most of the time
- isn’t babbling
- isn’t turning her head towards sounds or voices.

## Behaviour 
Your child:
- doesn’t smile or show if he’s happy or sad
- shows little or no affection for carers – for example, he doesn’t cuddle you.

## Movement 
Your child:
- isn’t rolling
- can’t sit up on her own
- uses one hand a lot more than the other.

You should also see a health professional if you notice that your baby has lost skills that he had before.

You should also see your child and family health nurse or GP if you notice the signs of postnatal depression in women or postnatal depression in men in yourself or your partner. Symptoms of postnatal depression include feeling sad and crying for no obvious reason, feeling irritable, having difficulty coping and feeling very anxious.
