Your baby is very interested in conversations. You’ll often hear baby’s first word around this age. She’s still babbling but might try out one or two words she knows the meaning of, especially ‘dada’ or ‘mama’.

But if your baby isn’t talking yet, don’t worry – he’ll communicate with you using body language like waving and pointing. He’ll also stop what he’s doing when he hears ‘no’.

When you sing with your baby, she might join in. She also enjoys looking at pictures in books and loves reading with you.

Over the past few months your baby has learned to show emotions like caution and fear. But now he might start to feel more comfortable around strangers and show fewer signs of stranger anxiety than he used to. He’s also more aware of his own needs, and can let you know what he wants.

Your baby is busy learning all the time. She loves finding hidden objects – for example, a toy hidden under a cup – or getting you to show her how things work – for example, the lid on a container. She’s also reaching out and grabbing things, using them and maybe even throwing them!

Your baby will probably need help to stand, but he might try standing on his own for a few seconds. He’s more comfortable walking around if he can hold onto furniture or he might want to hold your hand. But sometimes he wants to try walking on his own without your help.

At this age your baby might also:
- bounce to music
- copy simple sounds
- cooperate more when she’s getting dressed.

# When to be concerned about baby development

See your child and family health nurse or GP if you have any concerns or notice that your 11-month-old is having any of the following issues.

## Seeing, hearing and communicating 
Your child:
- isn’t making eye contact with you, following moving objects with her eyes or has an eye that is turned in or 
- out most of the time
- isn’t babbling
- isn’t turning her head towards sounds or voices.

## Behaviour 
Your child:
- doesn’t smile
- doesn’t show when he’s happy or sad.


## Movement 
Your child:
- can’t sit on her own
- uses one hand a lot more than the other.
- You should also see a child health professional if you notice your child has lost skills he had before.

You should also see your child and family health nurse or GP if you notice the signs of postnatal depression in women or postnatal depression in men in yourself or your partner. Symptoms of postnatal depression include feeling sad and crying for no obvious reason, feeling irritable, having difficulty coping and feeling very anxious.
