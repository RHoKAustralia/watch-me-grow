Around this time your baby starts working out how to learn more about his world. For example, he’ll look closely at objects like rings or bells, uncover toys after seeing them hidden, bang blocks together and look for them when he drops them. He’ll still put most things into his mouth too.

Your baby is getting better at picking up things using her thumb and pointer finger. She might also feed herself with her fingers.

Crawling, rolling or shuffling are all ways your baby might be moving around. He can sit on his own and might also pull himself up onto his knees.

At this age, your baby loves playing with you and really enjoys games like peekaboo, ringing bells and finding toys. Copying what you do and making funny sounds or animal noises together with you are lots of fun for your baby. Playing together also helps baby feel loved and secure.

Your baby is babbling. If she’s an early talker you might hear her say 1-2 words like ‘mama’ or ‘dada’, but she won’t know what these words mean. If she’s not using words yet, don’t worry – she’ll use body language to communicate with you. For example, she might shake her head for ‘no’ or wave goodbye.

At this age your baby’s emotions are developing, and he’ll let you know when he’s happy or upset. He might show strong attachment to you and other close family members or carers, but he’s still a bit afraid of new faces. This might show up as separation anxiety and stranger anxiety, which are both a normal part of children’s development around this age.

At this age your baby might also:

- try to chew, which means she’s now ready for food mashed or minced into small pieces
- try to feed herself – for example, by picking up her food or holding a drink bottle by herself
- respond to ‘Come here’
- look for family members if you ask her to – for example, if you say, ‘Where’s Mummy?’, she might look around for her mother
- stand with help.

# When to be concerned about baby development
See your child and family health nurse or GP if you have any concerns or notice that your eight-month-old is having any of the following issues.

## Seeing, hearing and communicating 
Your child:
- isn’t making eye contact with you, isn’t following moving objects with her eyes or has an eye that is turned in or out most of the time
- isn’t babbling
- isn’t turning her head towards sounds or voices.

## Behaviour 
Your child:
- doesn’t smile or show if he’s happy or sad
- shows little or no affection for carers – for example, he doesn’t cuddle you.

## Movement 
Your child:
- isn’t rolling
- feels very floppy or stiff
- can’t sit up or stand up with your help
- uses one hand a lot more than the other.
- You should also see a health professional if you notice that your baby has lost skills that she once had.
