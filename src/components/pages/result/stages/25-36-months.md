## Feelings
This is one of your child’s most important ages for emotional development.

You toddler is going through lots of emotions, while also learning about other people’s feelings. Temper tantrums are normal, because children often don’t know how to put words to ‘big’ emotions like frustration, anger, embarrassment, guilt and shame.

Your toddler is also starting to understand how her behaviour affects you and how your behaviour affects her. She won’t have as much separation anxiety, and might not get so upset when you leave her.

## Talking 
Around two years, your toddler might be able to use sentences of 2-3 words and say ‘I’, ‘you’ and ‘me’. He’ll learn and use lots of words and will be easier to understand when he’s talking.

At three years, your child will be able to use sentences of 3-5 words, or even more. She’ll start learning how to take turns when speaking, and might be able to have a short conversation with you.

Your child is learning how to talk about things that have happened during the day. With your help, he might be able to put things in order to make a simple story – for example, ‘I go shop.’ ‘And what did you do at the shop?’ ‘Buy milk.’ By three years, he might be able to tell a simple ‘made-up’ story based on his experiences, but it will probably be quite short.

At this age your child will also talk about people and objects that aren’t with her – for example, ‘Grandma at the shops’, or ‘My ball in tree’.

## Thinking 
Everything your child has learned so far has developed his thinking.

Your child is starting to understand concepts like time and opposites – for example, big/small and day/night. She’ll also start to point to body parts based on what they do, sort objects, and match shapes and colours. And she’s starting to remember what some things look like – for example, apples look red and round.

Your child solves problems by trying things out.

## Playing and learning 
Play is important because it’s how your child learns.

Your child will enjoy playing with others, playing dress ups, having tea parties, painting with his fingers or a brush and playing ‘rough and tumble’. When he plays with you or other children, you might find that your child is getting better at taking turns.

Telling stories, singing and reading are also fun things for your child to do at this age.

## Everyday skills 
Around this time, your child is keen to do more things for herself.

For example, he can probably wash his own hands, wash himself at bathtime, feed himself and get dressed – although he’s probably better at taking clothes off than putting them on! And he’s still learning so you might still need to help.

You can build your child’s confidence in doing things herself by letting her help you around the house with chores like sweeping or dusting. She’ll feel very proud when she’s a good helper.

Your toddler might even be ready to start toilet training. Some of the signs your child is ready for toilet training are if he:
- can do most things that you ask without your help
- is interested in watching others go to the toilet – this can be awkward or make you uncomfortable at first, but it’s a good way to introduce things
- lets you know when he does a poo or wee in his nappy
- can follow simple instructions, such as ‘Give the ball to Daddy’.

Watch and see whether your child is ready for toilet training – but try not to push it. Going to the toilet is one of the hardest things for your child to learn because it uses so many skills. For example, your child must know when she needs to do a wee or a poo, understand that she should do wees and poos in the toilet, be able to walk and climb onto the potty or toilet, and pull clothes up and down.

If you start toilet training too early, it might take your child a while to learn.
 
## Moving
Your toddler can run and will probably fall less. He’s starting to walk up and down stairs on his own, but will sometimes use the rail for balance. He’s now better at throwing overarm, kicking and catching a ball, and might even stand on one foot for a few seconds.

If you’re around while your child explores, she feels reassured and safe. This helps your child to build confidence to try new things and explore on her own.

With your child so active, it’s a good idea to look at how you can make your home safe for him to move around in.
 
At this age, your toddler might also:
- jump on the spot
- ride a tricycle
- recognise objects and name them
- alternate feet when walking up stairs.
