## Feelings and behaviour 
At this age, your child is exploring and learning to express his emotions. He’ll do this in many ways – for example, by talking, using gestures and noises, painting and making things.

Your preschooler also likes to be around people. She might want to please and be like her preschool-age friends. Imaginary friends could be important to her too. As part of getting along with others, you might hear her saying sorry, agreeing to rules and being pleased when good things happen to other people.

When it comes to cooperating, your child is likely to be more helpful but sometimes he might still be demanding. By the time he’s five years old, he’ll probably have more control over his behaviour and have fewer temper tantrums.

Your child might feel anxious about starting school. Talking to her about this and even visiting the school together can help her feel less worried.

In this year, your child might hide the truth about things sometimes, or even start telling lies. For example, he might say ‘I didn’t do it’ even when he did. This is a normal part of your preschooler’s development.

## Playing and learning 
Play is important because it’s still how your child learns and explores feelings.

When it comes to play, your child likes to sing, dance and act. She also loves make-believe play and is learning the difference between fantasy and reality. She’s more aware of her gender and might want to play gender-based games – for examples, girls might want to play at being ‘Mum’. Your child might also try different roles and behaviour, like being a doctor or getting married.

Your preschooler might be very curious about bodies – his own and other people’s. For example, you might find your child looking at his own and other children’s genitals. A combination of natural curiosity and role-playing is usually a normal part of childhood sexual behaviour.

Although sex play is normal at this age, if you’re concerned about a child’s sexual behaviour, it’s a good idea to talk with a GP, a paediatrician or another qualified health professional.

## Thinking 
Your preschooler will understand more about opposites – for example, high/low – know the names of letters and numbers out of order, and count to 10.

## Talking 
Your child’s language develops a lot this year, and you’ll notice that she loves telling stories and having conversations.

Your child will start to tell you how he feels, talk about his ideas and say words that rhyme. He’ll ask lots of questions and want to know the meaning of words. This is part of how he learns more about the world he lives in.

At four years, your preschooler knows hundreds of words and can use 5-6 words or more in sentences. You’ll be able to understand what she’s saying all the time.

By five years, your child will speak more clearly and will know, understand and use even more words, often in more complex sentences of about six words or more.

## Daily life 
Dressing himself is pretty easy for your child now. He can also use a fork, spoon and sometimes a knife – for example, to spread butter on bread. You still need to supervise him, but he can go to the toilet, bathe and brush his teeth by himself.

## Moving 
Your preschooler loves moving and being active. She’s better at walking down steps (maybe using the rail) with alternating feet, throwing, catching and kicking a ball, running, climbing, jumping, hopping and balancing on one foot.

Your child might also develop some new gross motor skills – for example, skipping, jumping backwards or jumping while running.

Your preschooler’s fine motor skills are improving too. He can put a paper clip on paper, cut with child-safe scissors, write his first name and some letters, and draw a triangle or a person with 8-10 body parts.

At this age, your child might also:
- say her own name, address and telephone number
- know her left from her right
- explain how some objects work – for example, how to close the lid on a jar
- work out which object is heavier
- name four colours
- talk about events in the past, present and future – for example, know the difference between things she has done, is doing and will do.

# When to be concerned about child development

See your child and family health nurse or GP if you have any concerns or notice that your four-year-old has any of the following issues.

## Seeing, hearing and communicating 
Your child:
- has trouble seeing or hearing things
- doesn’t use sentences of more than three words.

## Behavior and play 
Your child:
- can’t understand two-part commands like ‘Put the doll down, and pick up the ball’
- doesn’t pretend during play – for example, doesn’t pretend to be mum or dad
- has very challenging behaviour – for example, has big tantrums over very small things or still clings or cries when you leave
- seems very afraid, unhappy or sad a lot of the time.

## Movement and motor skills 
Your child:
- is clumsy – for example, trips over a lot when walking or running
- finds it hard to handle small objects – for example, a pencil or crayon
- has trouble drawing shapes – for example, a circle or square
- has difficulty eating, dressing or using the toilet.

See your child and family health nurse or GP if you notice your five-year-old has any of the following issues.

## Seeing, hearing and communicating 
Your child:
- has trouble seeing or hearing things
- isn’t developing conversational skills – for example, doesn’t understand how to talk, listen and respond.

## Behavior and play 
Your child:
- can’t understand three-part commands like ‘Put the doll down, get the ball from under the chair and put it in the box’
- doesn’t play with other children or acts in a very aggressive way
- seems very afraid, unhappy or sad a lot of the time
- is easily distracted and can’t concentrate on any single activity for more than a few minutes
- doesn’t pretend during play – for example, doesn’t play doctors and nurses, construction in the sandpit or cooking.

## Movement and motor skills 
Your child:
- is clumsy – for example, trips over a lot when walking or running
- finds it hard to use small objects – for example, a pencil or crayon
- has trouble drawing shapes – for example, a circle or square
- has difficulty eating, dressing or using the toilet.

You should see a child health professional if at any age your child experiences a noticeable and consistent loss of skills he once had.

Children grow and develop at different speeds. If you’re worried about whether your child’s development is ‘normal’, it might help to know that ‘normal’ varies a lot. But if you still feel that something isn’t quite right, see your child and family health nurse or GP.
