## Behaviour, play and feelings 
Your toddler is a busy little person. He’s spending a lot of his time working out what different things do, and what he can do with them. He’ll build small towers of blocks and knock them down, scribble with a pen or crayon, and drop pegs into a basket.

This is an important time for your toddler socially and emotionally.

After 14 months, your child might often show signs of separation anxiety. But she’ll also begin to show empathy – for example, she might look sad or get upset when she sees someone else crying. Empathy is about understanding how others might be feeling, and it’s an important part of forming relationships with people.

## Communicating and talking 
At this age, your child’s language development matures. His babbling starts to include real words. Your child might even name familiar objects – for example, a ball. But it’s not all words just yet – he’ll still grunt, nod and point to let you know what he wants. He might even point to people and things he knows when you ask him.

## Movement 
Your toddler might stand up without needing help from you or the furniture in these months, and will probably start to walk on her own. As she gets better at walking, she might climb stairs or even the furniture.

Moving helps your child build muscle strength for more complex movements like standing, walking and running. If you’re around while your child explores, it helps him feel safe and builds his self-confidence.

If your child isn’t walking on her own yet, try not to worry too much. Some children won’t walk without help until 15-18 months.

At this age your child might also:
- hug you
- point to his body parts or a favourite toy when you name them
- drink from a cup – probably with some spills! – and use a spoon
- follow simple instructions – for example, when you say to your child, ‘Please give me the block’, he won’t need you to show him what to do
- try to help when you’re putting on his clothes, often by holding out his arms for sleeves or putting his foot up for shoes
- hold a crayon and possibly scribble with it after you show him how
- start to pretend when he plays – for example, he might pretend to drink from a cup.

# When to be concerned about toddler development
See your child and family health nurse or GP if you have any concerns or notice that at 12-15 months your toddler has any of the following issues.

## Seeing, hearing and communicating 
Your child:
- isn’t making eye contact with you, isn’t following moving objects with his eyes or has an eye that is turned in or out most of the time
- isn’t interested in sounds
- doesn’t respond to his name when called
- isn’t babbling or using single words
- isn’t trying to let you know what he wants
- isn’t using gestures like waving or pointing.

## Behaviour, play and feelings
Your child:
- doesn’t seem to understand you
- isn’t showing her emotions and feelings.
- Movement and motor skills

Your child:
- can’t stand even when by holding on to you or the furniture
- uses one hand a lot more than the other.

You should see a child health professional if you notice that your child has lost skills he had before.

You should also see your child and family health nurse or GP if you notice the signs of postnatal depression in women or postnatal depression in men in yourself or your partner. Symptoms of postnatal depression include feeling sad and crying for no obvious reason, feeling irritable, having difficulty coping and feeling very anxious.
