## Feelings 
At this age, your toddler starts to experience new emotions like anger and frustration, guilt, shame, possessiveness and excitement. These ‘big’ emotions can be hard to deal with for your toddler, and you might see some temper tantrums as a result.

Although your child’s separation anxiety peaks around 18 months, by two years it should start to settle down.

Your child is also beginning to think about how she feels, and might link her feelings with words – for example, she might tell you she’s ‘sad’. She might show affection by giving you a kiss or hugging a doll, which is also part of developing empathy.

## Everyday skills 
Around this time, your child is keen to be more do more things for himself.

For example, your child is learning to eat by herself using a spoon and cup, and maybe even a fork – there might even be fewer spills than before!

Your child might try to help when he’s getting dressed by taking off socks, shoes and clothes that don’t have buttons. At this age, it’s easier for him to take off his clothes than to put them on.

Generally, your child might show signs that she’s ready for toilet training from two years on. But it’s not unusual for some children to show signs of being ready earlier, at around 18 months.

## Playing and learning 
Play is important because it’s how your child learns.

Your child will be busy imagining and creating through pretend play – for example, by feeding a doll or pretending to use a phone. And he’ll enjoy spending time with his brothers and sisters and other children, even if he doesn’t play directly with them.

## Talking 
Your child enjoys talking, and her words might even have up-and-down tones, just like an adult’s. You’ll most likely hear a mix of ‘babble’ and real words.

At 18 months, your child is learning words all the time – usually 1-2 words a week, or maybe even one word a day. He might name and point at familiar objects, people and body parts – for example, ears, nose or toes – make animal sounds like ‘moo’, or say the same sound or word over and over.

Your toddler knows her name and the idea of ‘mine’. She’s getting better at understanding simple sentences and instructions like ‘Bring it to Mum’ or ‘Let’s go for a walk’. You’ll be able to understand more of what she says to you.

By two years, your toddler might be able to say ‘I’, ‘you’ and ‘me’, and use sentences with 2-3 words – for example, ‘Mummy car’ or ‘me do it’.

## Moving 
Your toddler will walk on his own by 18 months and begin to run. He’ll walk up and down stairs or climb furniture with your help. Throwing and kicking a ball, scribbling with pencils or crayons, and building small towers of blocks might be some of his favourite things.

It’s a good idea to look at how you can make your home safe for your active child to move around in.

At this age, your child might also:
- ask for ‘more’ and say ‘no’ when asked to do something
- copy you – for example, she might help you sweep the floor
- sit herself in a small chair
- walk around carrying larger objects
- use one hand more than the other by two years.

Symptoms of postnatal depression include feeling sad and crying for no obvious reason, feeling irritable, having difficulty coping and feeling very anxious.
