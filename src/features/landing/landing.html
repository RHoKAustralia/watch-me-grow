    <p>
        The Watch Me Grow (WMG) web app is a tool designed for you as a parent to
        track how well your child is developing. The WMG app uses two questionnaires:
        Q-CHAT is a quick referral guide for parents to indicate any concerns about
        their child’s language and social skills. PEDS asks questions about your
        child’s overall development. Parents are encouraged to use the WMG app at key
        stages in your child’s development at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months of age. If
        any concerns are flagged on either of these screening tools it is important to
        make an appointment to see your GP or another health professional.
